Shorty
============

This is a simple link shortener  that I did as a part of a job interview sometime back.

Exercise
---------
Link Shortener

Objective: 

Build a small link shortener service with an API as well as a small web front-end.
- The link shortener should be able to receive a URL and give back a shortened URL.
- When a user accesses the shortened URL he should be redirected to the full URL.
- It should have a small API where you can query stats around a particular shortened URL giving you 
details about the users that have visited the URL with as much information as you can get on that person.
